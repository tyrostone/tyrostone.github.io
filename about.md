I currently work as a DevOps Engineer for Veracode, a software security company in the Boston area. 

I have a passion for automation, as well as experimenting with new tools. In my day-to-day, I  architect and design cloud-based systems, specifically in AWS. I build system tools and applications with Python and Go, and automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments. I love learning new technologies and am constantly pushing my own boundaries.
