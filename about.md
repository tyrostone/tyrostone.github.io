Hi, Iâ€™m Laura. I believe that done is better than perfect, that iteration, simplicity, and customer feedback are keys to success, and that community-driven efforts lead to powerful change. I currently work at [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com) as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer. I'm also the author of the [DevOps Foundations: Microservices](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/devops-foundations-microservices) and [Graphite and Grafana](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/graphite-and-grafana-visualizing-application-performance/monitoring-and-visualizing-system-performance) courses on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning).

Outside of work, you can find me organizing the [Boston Devops meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Devops/) and [DevOpsDays Boston conference](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2019-boston/welcome/), enjoying a nice cup of tea and board games with friends, or watching professional Starcraft 2 to relax.
